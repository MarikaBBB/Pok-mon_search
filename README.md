# Pokémon Search App

This project was developed during a workshop for FAC29 Foundation. The aim was to create a web application allowing users to search for their favourite Pokémon using the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).

For more details about this workshop, you can refer to [Real World Fetch Workshop](https://learn.foundersandcoders.com/workshops/real-world-fetch/).

## Features

- A form with a **search input** and **submit button**.
- When the form is submitted, the application fetches details about the Pokémon from `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/NAME`.
- If the request is successful, the application displays the Pokémon's **name** and **sprite**.
- In the event of a failed request, the application shows a relevant error to the user.

## Stretch Goals

For those looking to further enhance the application:
- Explore the API's response to display additional data, such as the Pokémon's **types** or **stats**.
- Add some custom CSS to beautify the application.
